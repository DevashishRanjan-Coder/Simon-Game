#Simon Game

This is an attempt at making a digital version of the Simon electronic game.

The games logic is written in javascript and the structure and styling is done using HTML and CSS respectively.

This project helped me understand and practice how to manipulate HTML elements/handle CSS animations using jQuery and how to use the HTML Audio() element.
